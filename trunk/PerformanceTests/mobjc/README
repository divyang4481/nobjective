BUILDING

Navigate to the mobjc directory with a terminal and type
`make` to make the libraries and the application. Type `make check`
to run the unit tests and `make run-app` to run the sample Cocoa app.

INSTALLING

To install type `sudo make install`, to uninstall type `sudo make uninstall`.

By default the libraries are installed into /usr/local/lib and
the cocoa-pack script is installed into /usr/local/bin. You can 
change this with a command like this: `make INSTALL_DIR=/tmp install`.

USING

For usage see the wiki: <http://code.google.com/p/mobjc/w/list>.
Also look at the sample app (but note that this is not how applications
should typically be written, see mcocoa's animating-views example for
that).
