	* ViewSample.cs:
	Because the Cocoa namespace has a Font class now, this
        example must use the fully qualified name System.Drawing.Font.

	* CocoaDoc.cs:
	(FinishLoading): Removed the mainWindow.Center () call.
	* CocoaDoc.nib: Added AutoSaveName to retain window settings between

	Browser View placement in MainWindow.
