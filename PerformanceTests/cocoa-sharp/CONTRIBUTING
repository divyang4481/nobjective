Patch Submission Process:

	Send your patch in "svn diff" format to the Cocoa# mailing list (cocoa-sharp@lists.ximian.com).  
	Start the subject with [PATCH].  If your patch is changing the runtime functionality take the 
	time to explain what it is changing and why.


Patch Submission Requirements:

	All patches that change any public facing classes or add any new classes are REQUIRED to have
	the corresponding documentation patches or they will not be accepted.

Class Addition Guidelines
-------------------------

	Every class added to Cocoa# must be hand bound and tested.  The format for making a Cocoa# class
	is quite simple:
		1. The class must include a private static string called ObjectiveCName which is the native
		   objc classname (ie: NSString)
		2. The class must have a constructor that accepts a IntPtr and calls the base ctor
		   (ie; public NSString (IntPtr native_object) : base (native_object) {})
		3. All messages that go to the objc runtime MUST use the ObjCMessaging class.
		4. All conversions must use the helper methods in the Native class.
