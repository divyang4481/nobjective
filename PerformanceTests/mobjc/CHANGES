-- Version 0.4.0.0 (r40) ----

* Renamed IVar IBOutlet.
* DirectCall p/invokes are now externally visible so mcocoa can use them for
  its fast path.
* Optimized object creation and a few other commonly used methods.
* Fixed the registration of types so that we look at the attributes on the
  type alone, not the type and its bases.
* Type registration was not sorting the types quite right so it failed with
  complex exported hierarchies.
* Replaced DBC asserts with Trace.Assert. Unfortunately these default to doing
  nothing. To get asserts to throw you can call the new AssertListener.Install
  method.

-- Version 0.3.0.0 (r16) ----

* Simplified the library:
	- removed support for formatted calls (Call("[[NSFoo alloc] initWithInt:{0}]", 100).
	- removed the Untyped class
	- typing is now stricter: in particular promotions will generally not be
	  done automatically, if native code expects an int you can no longer pass
	  in a short for example
	- replaced NewMethodAttribute and OverrideMethodAttribute with RegisterAttribute
	- public nullary and unary methods that start with a lower case letter are
	  now automatically registered
* Methods that call directly into Objective-C now start with a lower case letter
  (like retain() and mutableCopy()).
* A number of minor bugs have been fixed.

-- Version 0.2.0.0 (r35) ----

* Changed namespace casing.
* Completely changed memory management. NSObject no longer fiddles with 
  reference counts and is not IDisposeable. A one-to-one mapping between
  managed and native instances is now maintained only for exported classes.
  This means that clients can use the same rules in managed code as they
  would in native code.
* The memory unit tests now all pass and the memory stress test in the
  sample no longer exhibits slow growth in the heap size.
* Does a better job marshaling exceptions to native code when they aren't
  serializeable.
* Does a better job marhsaling null to native code.
* Can now use RegisterAttribute on classes to allow them to be used as 
  managed method argument types.  
* NSObject, MethodSignature, and Untyped override Equals and GetHashCode.
* Makefile targets are now rebuilt if gmcs or gcc flags change.
* pkg-config pc file now supports the "Libraries with Unstable APIs" 
  paradigm.
* Renamed NativeValue Untyped.
* Added an IVar class to provide type safe access to instance vars.
* Added Snapshot which returns all NSObject's which are still around (in
  debug).
* Added a cocoa-pack script to build app bundles. This is like mono's
  macpack except:
  - it's not neccesary to delete the bundle before running the script.
  - you can specify flags to use with mono (e.g. --debug).
  - flags passed to the launcher script are forwarded to the assembly.
  - instead of creating a lame Info.plist it copies (and seds) an existing one.
  - mdb files are automatically copied if --debug is in the mono flags.
  - localized resources are supported.
  - .svn directories inside nibs are not copied into the bundle.
  - the script doesn't export any environment variables so it may not 
    work with winforms or other cocoa bridges.
